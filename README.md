Introduction:

Virtual auctions on the internet. The seller sells the product or service to the person who bids the highest price. For sellers, online auctions open up new sales channels for new products and offer buyers favorable purchasing conditions.
Online auctions have effectively created a giant virtual marketplace where people can gather to buy, sell, trade and check out the goods of the day. They're enormously popular, high-traffic venues where you can begin selling product almost immediately, with...
•	No overhead or upfront costs
•	No sales staff or distributors
•	No website of your own
•	No initial investment (you'll pay between 2 and 5 percent of your final sale price to the auction site)
